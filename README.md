📘 Career Conversation Chatbot (AI Digital Twin)

This project is a personal AI chatbot that represents me professionally. It answers career-related questions using my LinkedIn profile and summary as context, and interacts with visitors as if they were speaking to me directly.

The chatbot is powered by Google Gemini (via OpenAI-compatible API format), uses function calling for structured actions, and runs with a Gradio chat interface.

The goal is simple:
Create a professional AI digital twin that can engage website visitors, answer questions about my career, and capture leads automatically.
